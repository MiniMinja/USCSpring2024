# Partitions

## Definition

A sequence $(a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_k)$ of non-negative integers which sum to $n$ is called a _weak composition_ of $n$. If we require that the $a_i$s are all positive, we get a _composition_ of $n$. We call $a_1, a_2,...,a_k$ the _parts_ of the composition. Earlier we proved

1. For $n, k > 0$ the number of weak compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts is $\begin{pmatrix}n+k-1\\k-1\end{pmatrix}$.

2. For the number of compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts is $\begin{pmatrix}n-1\\k-1\end{pmatrix}$.

## Corollary

For all positive integers $n$, the total number of compositions is $2^{n-1}$.

_Ex: Let $n=3$, the possible compositions are $\{3\}, \{2+1\}, \{1+2\}, \{1+1+1\}$._

Exercise: _Try to prove the corollary_
