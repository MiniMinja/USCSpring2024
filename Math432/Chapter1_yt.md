# Pigeonhole Principle

_"combinatorics is an honest subject. You can count balls in boxes and either you have the right number or you haven't"_ - Gian-Carlo ROTA


Combinatorics is a concrete subject: you can do it with your hands. Construct an image, draw an example.

_Pigeonhole Principle_

$k$ balls into $n$ boxes
 and $k > n$

$\rightarrow$ at least 1 box has 2 balls


When we have a statement that is _painfully_ obvious, we will use proof by contradiction.


__Proof__

Suppose not ($k > n$ s.t. no box has at least 2 balls _i.e. each box has $\leq$ 1 ball_). That means the number of balls $k$ must be at most the number of boxes $n$ (i.e. $k \leq n$). Which is a contradiciton.

__Example__

Among any 7 people living in the contiguous U.S., at least 2 people live within 1500 miles of one another.

_Ask_: which are the balls? and which are the boxes? 

- You can think of "objects" as balls and "properties" as boxes.

So the balls are _people_ and the boxes are _anything that has the property of being close together_
This means I need 6 (or less) "boxes". Draw a picture: (pigeonholeex1.png)
