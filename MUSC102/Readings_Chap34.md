## The 4 Basic Properties of Tones

Duration
: How long a tones is

Frequency
: How high or low a tone is in pitch

Amplitude
: How loud or soft a tone is

Timbre
: sound quality/color

## Rhythm

rhythm
: how the sounds and silences are organized in time

* **Sixteenth notes, eight notes, quarter notes**

### Beat
: underlying pulse

### Subdivision
: when beats are divided into smaller rhythmic units

### Meter
: number of beats in a **measure**

measure
: grouping of beats in Western music

_ex_) Alphabet Music is a meter of 4

### Accent and Syncopation

accent
: notes that are given a little more _oomph_, emphasis

syncopation
: accented notes that fall in-between the beats

### Tempo

- The rate at which beats pass

### Free Rhythm

- music with no discernible beat, seeming to float across time instead of march with it

metric music
: music with discernible meter/tempo

# Chapter 4

## Pitch and Melody

Melody
: the particular sequence of pitches

Distinct Features:

1. **Melodic Range**
: the distance from the lowest note to the highest

2. **Melodic Direction**
: the upward/downward movement of the melody

3. **Melodic Contour**
: the overall "shape" of the music, a product of _range_ and _direction_ and other things

### Names of Pitches

* A
* B
* C
* D
* E
* F
* G

determinant pitch
: being able to discern the exact pitch when played on an instrument

_ex_) piano, xylophone

indeterminant pitch
: not being able to discern the exact pitch

_ex_) drums, triangle, cymbals

### The Western pitch system and the octave

The 12 pitches in Western music are on the piano

scale
: ascending/descending series of notes of different pitches

octave
: the same pitch of a note, but higher or lower

### Common scales in Western Music

interval
: the distance between any two notes

_**Major Scale**_
: The white keys starting with C

_**Pentatonic Scale**_
: The keys C D E G A starting with C

_**Minor Scale**_
: like major scale, but the third key is typically down a half-step

_**Blues Scale**_
: starting on C, the notes C Eb F F# G Bb

### Scales in non-Western music systems

Gamelan music have 2 pitch systems, slendro and pelog, but they have nothing to do with Western 12 pitch system. They are pentatonic, but not the same pentatonic as Western music. 

Arab traditional music is built from

microtones
: tiny intervals.

articulation
: examples include

legato
: sustained notes

staccato
: clipped notes

## Pitch, Chords, Harmony

chord
: when two or more notes are played simultaneously

harmony
: when a chord "makes sense" in the context of the overall piece of music

chord progression
: the product of moving from one chord to another

harmonization
: the result of when each notes becomes the basis of its own chord

arpeggio
: the "broken chord", each tone presented one at a time
