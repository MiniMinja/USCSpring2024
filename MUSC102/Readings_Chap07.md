## Similarities across Javanese and Balinese Gamelan

* Similar instruments

* Cyclical Music

* Related scales, tunings, modes

ombak
: "wave", the "out-of-tuneness"

male instruments are tunes slightly higher than female instruments. These notes when struck produce ombak.

* Melodic organizations (core melody plays slower, embellished by faster playing melodies), multipart textures where higher pitched instruments play at faster rates

* a historical background of Hindu religion, represented symbolically in music

## Differences

* Energy, tempo

* mood

* social symbolism (Bali - competitions, Javanese - more intimate)

* drumming (Bali - a lot of interlocking)

* Paired tuning of instruments (Bali)

## Gamelan Belenganjur  

"gamelan of walking warriors" - it _moves_

gamelan
: "ensemble", "orchestra"

Though they consist of many instruments, they are considered one instrument. Each is considered unique, different from other gamelans.

Gilak gong cycle
: a 8 beat cycle of Belenganjur

Basically, there's a section in the book that goes into detail about the procession of someone's death. Essentially, they have to fight off evil spirits during the funeral, so they do the Gamelan music and dances and they even have some tower so that the spirit can go freely without being trapped by an evil spirit. In an intersection, they are the most vulnerable, so the music gets most intense, and the tower spins. The music is meant to instill fear into the evil spirits.
