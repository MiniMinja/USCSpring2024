# Some Notes Immediately After

## Certain things I noticed

* The lights act as an indication of a start/end of the next segment, not unlike a movie theater. Before it's a lot of tuning and people chattering, but when the lights dim a little, everyone knows it's time

* Everyone claps when a violinist steps out (what is that?). Then they also clap when the conductor steps out.

* During the break the conductor steps out, almost as if to indicate like the supervisor is out/this segment isn't part of a strictly musical performance (although it's arguable that the entire thing is a performance). Some members of the orchestra also step out.

* When it became clear the performance was done, everyone suddenly snapped into being individuals again. People resumed chattering. People pointed out certain performers on stage.

## Some cool things

* Somehow I found myself having transitioned from a state of viewing the orchestra as a group of synchronized individuals into a state of seeing one collective unit, not just the players but the audience as well. We were all part of the performance (not unlike the "magic circle" in games)

* Instead of hearing the music as some organized sound (which I initially sort of tried very hard to make sense of the organization), at some point, the whole song just kind of played, flowing from one part to the next. The sounds were lost and the music was found.

* At the end of the main performance, the conductor made a little surprise (everyone stomped their feet, a giant projector came down). He presented a picture of Strauss and Brahm and told a story about how Brahm wrote a special song on a fan which Strauss wrote a whole iconic song that everyone knows (he didn't mention the name).

* During the last song, I suddenly felt this feeling of love, admiration, this desire to give to friends whatever they can (as the conductor had previously mentioned) during the song. It was a praise of the melodic piece, but it was also the appreciation of the individual.
