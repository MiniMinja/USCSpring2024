**The Hornbostel-Sachs Classification System**

* Chordophones

Sounds made by vibration of strings over a chamber

_ex: guitar, violin_

* Aerophones

Sounds made by passing air through a tube or some resonator

_ex: trumpet, organ_

* Membraphones

Sounds made with vibration of a _membrane_ over some resonator

_ex: drums_

* Idiophones

Sounds made with the vibration of the instrument itselft

_ex: triangles, shakers, hand claps_

* Electronophones

Two subcategories: 

1. Pure - if you try to play with without plugging it, nothing happens

Digital synthesizers, and samplers

2. Hybrid - if you try to play with without plugging it, you can still make out the sounds

Electric guitar

Two Types:

1. sound generators

2. sound modifiers

One of the greatest inventions is **multitrack recording**. You can layer multiple musical tracks ontop of each other (**overdubbing**). 

_Some compound instruments_

Consists of multiple instruments, but is classified as one (_ex: drums_).
