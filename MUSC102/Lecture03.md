# Manaus and Amazonas

It's a special economic zone in Brazil. Like the Chinese mega-population, can produce large amounts of exports. Hella fish to eat. 

A lot of Western music (after all, western music penetrated everywhere). Manaus took all of it. 

Founded in 1699, 2 mill residents. Approximately 50% of the population. Biggest industrial region - big cargo ships take Honda and Harley Davidson products through the river to the Atlantic Ocean. Gateway to the Amazon forest, tourism.

## Rubber Trade

(1850 - 1900s)

Discovery of rubber by Charles Goodyear made rubber useful (vulcanization - makes rubber long lasting). Height of the boom in Manaus 1890-1910. Monopoly on the world supply.

People worked on tree to gather tree sap. A lot of indigenous slavery.

## Teatro Amazonas
