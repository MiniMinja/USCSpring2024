# Texture

Single-line/Monophonic textures
: as long as multiple people play all in unison, this is monophonic texture.

Polyphonic Textures
: when there's 2+ distinct parts. even a single human can perform polyphonic texture, like on a piano

_Simplist polyphonic texture: melody + drone (like scottish bagpipes)_

Harmonized Textures
: when each notes of different pitches occur together and form harmonies

Multiple-melody Texture
: When multiple melody play on top of each other

Polyrhythm
: music that's in several different layers wach defined by its distinctive rhythmic character rather than chords or melodies

Interlocking
: When a single melodic/rhythmic line is played across different instruments

Call-and-response
: back-and-forth alternations between different instruments or voice parts

# Form: The designs of Musical Works

Form
: has to do with how it's laid out from beginning to end

## Forms based on reptition and patterns

- **Ostinato-based forms**

ostinato
: a short figure that is repeated over and over

Continual presence of ostinato, but it's slight alteration with each repetition

- **Cyclic forms**

cycle
: similar to an ostinato, but is longer

_ex_: 12-bar blues

## Forms with contrasting sections

- **Verse-chorus form**

verses/choruses (A/B sections)
