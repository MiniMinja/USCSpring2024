### *5 propositions* that attempt to understand what music is

1. All music is sound

tone
: a musical sound. If a sound is musical, it is a tone

Anybody can define a tone as however they want, so some can say something is music while other say it's not


2. The sounds that comprise musical works is organized in some way


3. Music is a humanly organized sound

Basically, animals do not sing. They "sing" because we attribute that word because of we're humans.


4. Music is a product of human intention and perception

HIP (human intention and perception) approach
: (1) privileges inclusiveness over exclusiveness (2) music is inseparable from the people who make it or experience it

According to this model, _4'33''_ is a piece of music because the composer made with the intention of music, the performers perform with the intention of music, and some of the audience considers it music.


5. Music, the term is tied to Western culture and assumptions

ethnocentrism
: imposing of our own culturally grounded beliefs, biases, practices
