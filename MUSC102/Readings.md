## Chapter 1

### *5 propositions* that attempt to understand what music is

#### 1. All music is sound

tone
: a musical sound. If a sound is musical, it is a tone

Anybody can define a tone as however they want, so some can say something is music while other say it's not


#### 2. The sounds that comprise musical works is organized in some way


#### 3. Music is a humanly organized sound

Basically, animals do not sing. They "sing" because we attribute that word because of we're humans.


#### 4. Music is a product of human intention and perception

HIP (human intention and perception) approach
: (1) privileges inclusiveness over exclusiveness (2) music is inseparable from the people who make it or experience it

According to this model, _4'33''_ is a piece of music because the composer made with the intention of music, the performers perform with the intention of music, and some of the audience considers it music. According to HIP, it _is_ music


#### 5. Music, the term is tied to Western culture and assumptions

ethnocentrism
: imposing of our own culturally grounded beliefs, biases, practices

## Chapter 2

ethnomusicology
: the interdisciplinary academic field that draws on musicology, anthropology, other disciplines to study world music

the musicultural phenomenon
: the phenomenon where _music as sound_ and _music as culture_ are mutually reinforcing

### Culture in Music 

culture
: the complex whole which includes knowledge, art, belief, law, morals, custom, any other capailities and habits acquired by man as members of society _(communities)_

`Music is a mode of cultural production and representation.`

### Meaning in Music

Music isn't music until a meaning is connected to the sound

The meaning can be found in two ways:

1. Meaning relative to one another

*  notes
: specific tones in a piece of music

* pitch
: relative highness and lowness of notes

2. Meaning that transcends musical piece itself

_ex)_ What if Mary had a Little Lamb was a sad funeral song?

### Identity in Music

identity
: idea of who they are and what units/distinguishes them ffrom other peoples/entities

Music provides answers to _who am I?_ and _who are we?_. It also provides answers to _who is she/he?_ and _who are they?_.

_Rabbit Dance_ (song)

vocables
: a term used to describe nonlinguistic syllables
(_ex_ scatting)

#### Societies

society
: group of persons regarded as forming as single community of related interdependent individuals

social institutions
: a group that gathers for some social purpose (_ex_ curches, sororieties/fraternities, synagogues)

Focus is the impact of musicians/musical institutions on societies. (_ex_ Bali's gemelan club. First male only, now women can play too).
